PROJECT TITLE: AVIN INFLUENZA IN IRELAND (EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS )


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasmeet0516/bird-flu-dataset-avian-influenza)


This dataset provides comprehensive insights into the distribution and potential spread of avian influenza, commonly known as "Bird Flu," in Ireland. Avian influenza is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease primarily affecting birds, with wild migratory water birds being the main reservoir of the virus.

The dataset includes information about bird species captured in Ireland from 1980 to 2020, focusing on species targeted for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. Understanding the geographic distribution of these bird species is crucial for assessing the risk of the introduction of avian flu into Ireland, especially during migratory seasons when wild birds arrive and congregate on wetlands, potentially mixing with resident species.

QUESTIONS EXPLORED
Which bird species are most captured

The distribution of captured birds over the years

The distribution of captured birds across provinces

The distribution of birds captured over the months 


The top 10 species captured for Avian Influenza tests are the European Robin, Black-headed Gull, Rook, Gray Heron, Hooded Crow, Mute Swan, Eurasian Jackdaw, White Wagtail, Herring Gull, Eurasian Oystercatcher. This is important because wild birds are important reservoirs for avian influenza and tracking their presence within the country would help improve surveillance. 

There was a low incidence of avian influenza from 1980  to 2000, However, the number continually increased from then with a peak number of cases recorded in 2019. This highlights the need for future surveillance and risk assessment in the coming years.

  
 The province of Leinster had the highest number of cases while the province of Ulster had the lowest number of cases. Understanding at-risk areas during an outbreak would help improve advisory communication and strategies to mitigate the outbreak. The month of May till September had the highest number of cases with a peak happening in August. This can also be combined with migratory patterns of birds around the area to improve surveillance and monitoring.
The map of the distribution of captured birds and cases shows that they occur mostly along the borders of Ireland and might be a piece of useful information for surveillance and sampling. 

More information is needed about local poultry holdings and spatial data to have a more comprehensive risk assessment analysis of avian influenza in Ireland.
